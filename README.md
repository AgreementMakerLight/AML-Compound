                  SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:                        
                                                              
  AML requires Java SE Runtime Environment 7. It will not     
  run on older Java versions.                                 
                                                              
  Memory usage depends on the size of the ontologies you are  
  working with. We recommend a minimum of 2 GB RAM for small  
  ontologies (<1,000 classes), 4 GB RAM for medium-sized      
  ontologies (<10,000 classes), 8 GB RAM for large ontologies 
  (<100,000 classes), and 16 GB RAM for larger ontologies.    
                                                              
  Please keep in mind that opening large ontologies may take  
  several minutes. Likewise, matching large ontologies may    
  also take several minutes.                                  
                                                 
                   COMPOUND AML USAGE:                        
                                                              
  You can run the Compound AML by opening the CompoundTest    
  class and inputting your source, target 1 and target        
  ontologies.                                                 
                                                              
  You can use any ontology but we strongly advise to choose    
  somewhat related ontologies. We also recommend to have a    
  target 2 ontology with classes with qualifying              
  characteristics.

  AML is a lightweight automated ontology matching system     
  specialized on biomedical ontologies but applicable to      
  other domains. It is described in:

  The Compound AML is mainly composed of a novel algorithm,   
  inspired by AML's WordMatcher, which produces compound       
  matches between three different ontologies. It is also       
  specialized on biomedical ontologies but it can possibly    
  be applied to other domains. It is described in:
